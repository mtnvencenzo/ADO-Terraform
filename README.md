# Repository for terraform resources to build out the devops projects and repos.
For more information on actual setup for ado and terraform see [this readme](./terraform/readme.md).

> The files in this repo are used to build out all of the azure devops projects, repos and settings.  This repo is the only one that is manually created.  Any other manual azure devops setup should not be made and should be generated via updates to these terraform files.

The `global` Azure Artifacts feed was manually created as no terraform support existed.
